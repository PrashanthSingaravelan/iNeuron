What is iterable ???
Iterable is an object, which one can iterate over (loop over). It generates an Iterator when passed to iter() method. 
which is used to iterate over an iterable object using __next__() method.

Define Iterator 
In computer programming, an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists
iterator is an object with a state so that it remembers where it is during an iteration, it also knows how to get the next value by using __next__()
When there is StopIteration exception, it means that the iterator has been exhausted and has no more values.
											
Every iterable is not an iterator.
Every iterator is also an iterable.

__iter__() --> can be executed by using iter(), if present --> it is an iterable
__next__() --> can be executed by using next(), if present --> it is an iterator

dir(object) --> Returns all the attributes of that object.

Why list is iterable but not an iterator ??
List is iterable 
dir(list1) contains __iter__() and doesn't contain __next__()
'''
list1 = [1,2,3]
print("Only List with __iter__()[iterable]")
print(dir(list1))
# print(next(list1))  --> Error : List object is not an iterator
# Then how for loop works over the list

i_list = iter(list1)
print("List along with __next__()[iterator]")
print(dir(i_list))

print(next(i_list))
print(next(i_list))
print(next(i_list))
# print(next(i_list)) --> Will show StopIteration (indicating there are no further elements to iterate)

'''
But why for loop doesn't raise this exception???
A normal for loop knows how to handle the StopIteration exception
								For loop At background 
When a for loop is executed, for statement calls iter() on the object, which it is supposed to loop over. 
If this call is successful, the iter call will return an iterator object that defines the method __next__(),
which accesses elements of the object one at a time.The __next__() method will raise a StopIteration exception,
if there are no further elements available.The for loop will terminate as soon as it catches a StopIteration exception.
